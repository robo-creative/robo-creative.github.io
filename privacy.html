                <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify you. Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data Robo Creative collects about the use of Robo Creative Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.</p>
                <p>Robo Creative may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable Robo Creative to identify you.</p>

                <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means personally identifiable information that specifically identifies you as an individual.</p>

                <p>Likely situations when you make personal data available to Robo Creative include, but are not limited to: (i) registration for Services, including leaderboards; (ii) subscribing to newsletters; (iii) requesting technical support; and (iv) otherwise through use of Robo Creative Services where personal data is required for use and/or participation.</p>

                <p>The types of personal data may vary depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. The personal data Robo Creative may collect, process and use may include, but are not limited to your name, screen/user name, Robo Creative Services' or third party service ID, e-mail address.</p>

                <p>Robo Creative may use personal and non-personal data, both individually and combined together, for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, providing customer and technical support, managing and providing Services (including managing advertisement serving), customizing Robo Creative's communications and to further develop the Services and other Robo Creative services and products. Robo Creative may combine non-personal data with personal data.</p>

                <p>From time to time, we may ask you to complete a voluntary survey in order to help us provide a better user experience. We will only request and therefore collect non-personal data.</p>

                <p>Robo Creative may use your personal data to send messages to you with informative and/or commercial content about Robo Creative's services or third party products and services Robo Creative thinks may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information.</p>

                <h4 class="header">3. Ad Serving Technology</h4>

                <p>Robo Creative reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Robo Creative or Robo Creative's partners and contractors. Robo Creative may employ third party ad serving technologies that use certain methods to collect information as a result of ad serving through Services. Robo Creative or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use demographic and location information as well as information logged from your hardware or device to ensure that appropriate advertising is presented within the Service. Robo Creative or third parties may collect and use data for this purpose including, but not limited to IP address (including but not limited to for purposes of determining your coarse location), Device ID, MAC, software, applications, hardware, and in-game information. The foregoing data may be used and disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of the company providing the ad serving technology.</p>

                <p>You recognize and agree that the advertising companies who deliver ads for Robo Creative may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. These ad serving technologies are integrated into Services; if you do not want to be subject to this technology, do not use or access Services. Although Robo Creative takes commercially reasonable steps to instruct such advertising companies to comply with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, Robo Creative does not have access to or control of third party technologies.</p>

                <p>Robo Creative may display to you behaviorally targeted advertising. If you wish to “opt out” of certain targeted advertising, please visit http://www.youradchoices.com and/or www.networkadvertising.org. If you want to be certain that no behaviorally targeted advertisements are not displayed to you, please do not use or access the Services. Additionally, please note that if you “opt out” it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising. It just means that the advertising you see displayed will not be customized to you and your interests and may be less relevant to you.</p>
